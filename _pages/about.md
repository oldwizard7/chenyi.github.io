Hello! I am a visiting student in the Department of Statistics at University of Wisconsin–Madison. My home institution is Wuhan University, where I major in Pure Mathematics.

My research focuses on LLM-based agent applications, agentic reinforcement learning, and decision-making under uncertainty. I build and evaluate tool-using agents that can reliably solve multi-step tasks, with applications in scientific discovery and optimization.

I have pursued a summer research internship at HKUST IEDA , where I worked on bilevel chance-constrained optimization for healthcare applications. This experience strengthened my ability to bridge rigorous mathematical foundations with practical applications, aiming to develop efficient, reliable, and interpretable methods for complex real-world problems
