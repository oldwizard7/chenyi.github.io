Hello! I am a visiting student in the Department of Statistics at University of Wisconsin–Madison. My home institution is Wuhan University, where I major in Pure Mathematics.

My research focuses on LLM-based agent applications, and Agentic reinforcement learning. I aim to develop principled, efficient, and reliable methods that make intelligent systems more trustworthy in complex real-world settings. If you have any openings, ideas, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out!

Currently, I am fortunate to be mentored by Prof. Xiao Luo at University of Wisconsin–Madison. I also collaborate closely with the Scalable Analytics Institute (ScAi) at UCLA. 

Previously, I completed a summer research internship at HKUST IEDA, working on decision-making under uncertainty.
