I am currently a fourth-year exchange student (VISP) at the Department of Statistics, University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. My home institution is Wuhan University in China, where I am majoring in Pure Mathematics.

My research interests lie at the intersection of AI, Data Science, and Operations Research, with an emphasis on interpretable large language models and algorithms for decision-making under uncertainty.

I have pursued a summer research internship at HKUST IEDA , where I worked on bilevel chance-constrained optimization for healthcare applications. This experience strengthened my ability to bridge rigorous mathematical foundations with practical applications, aiming to develop efficient, reliable, and interpretable methods for complex real-world problems
