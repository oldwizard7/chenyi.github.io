Hello! I am a visiting student in the **Department of Statistics** at **the University of Wisconsin–Madison**. My home institution is **Wuhan University**, where I major in Pure Mathematics.

My research focuses on LLM-based agent applications, and agentic reinforcement learning. I aim to develop principled, efficient, and reliable methods that make intelligent systems more trustworthy in complex real-world settings.

Currently, I am fortunate to be mentored by Prof. Xiao Luo at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. I also collaborate closely with the Scalable Analytics Institute (ScAi) at UCLA. 

Previously, I was a research intern at HKUST IEDA for six months in 2025, working on decision-making under uncertainty.

I am actively seeking research opportunities for Summer 2026. Feel free to reach out!
