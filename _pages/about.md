I am currently an exchange student(VISP) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison’s Department of Statistics. Also, I am a fourth-year undergraduate from Wuhan University, where my major is pure mathematics.

My research interests lie at the intersection of AI, Data Science, and Operations Research, with an emphasis on interpretable large language models and algorithms for decision making.

I have pursued a summer research internship at HKUST IEDA , where I worked on bilevel chance-constrained optimization for healthcare applications. This experience strengthened my ability to bridge rigorous mathematical foundations with practical applications, aiming to develop efficient, reliable, and interpretable methods for complex real-world problems
