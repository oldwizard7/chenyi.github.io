I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Wuhan University(https://math.whu.edu.cn/), with a strong foundation in pure mathematics and statistics. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and quantitative finance, focusing on chance-constrained optimization, bilevel programming, and interpretable large language models.  

I have pursued research experiences internationally, including a summer research internship at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (IEDA program) and a current exchange at the University of Wisconsin–Madison’s Department of Statistics. These experiences have strengthened my skills in algorithm design, probabilistic modeling, and large-scale optimization, bridging theoretical insights with practical applications in finance and AI.  

My current work explores the statistical foundations of model reliability, generalization, and interpretability in modern machine learning systems, aiming to develop efficient and trustworthy algorithms.
