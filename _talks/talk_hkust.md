This presentation outlines a bilevel chance-constrained programming model to optimize physician contracts under uncertain patient demand. The model addresses the inherent conflict between a clinic's goal to maximize service volume and a physician's need to control workload. We propose an iterative algorithm framework that combines Sample Average Approximation (SAA) and KKT conditions to generate robust solutions. Preliminary results from a case study inspired by the Mayo Clinic demonstrate the viability of our approach.
